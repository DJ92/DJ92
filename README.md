# Hi, I’m Dheeraj Joshi (DJ) 👋

Senior Systems & Machine Learning Engineer designing large-scale personalization,
search, recommendation, and GenAI systems.

📍 Boston, US  
🧠 ML Systems • Recommenders • GenAI / Agentic Workflows
⚡ Focus: retrieval → ranking → serving → experimentation

- 🛠 **Applied ML:** https://github.com/DJ92/applied-ml

---

## What I work on
- Designing and scaling **low-latency ML serving systems** in production
- Tuning & optimizing **large-scale ML training pipelines** for production
- Ranking and retrieval model architectures for large catalogs
- Feature stores, embeddings, and vector search infrastructure
- Bridging **offline metrics ↔ online impact** via scalable experimentation
- Production GenAI systems (RAG, agents, evaluation, guardrails)

## How I think
- Prefer **simple systems** with clearly stated tradeoffs
- Optimize for **observability, debuggability, and iteration speed**
- Treat ML models as **production software**, not research artifacts
